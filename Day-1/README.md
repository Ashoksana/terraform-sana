# Terraform Day 1 - Introduction and Basics

## Overview
Welcome to Day 1 of Terraform! Today, weâ€™ll cover the basics of Terraform, including its purpose, how it works, and the fundamental concepts you need to understand to get started with infrastructure as code (IaC).

## What is Terraform?
Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp. It allows you to define, provision, and manage infrastructure using a high-level configuration language called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) or JSON.

### Key Benefits of Terraform:
- **Declarative Syntax**: Describe the desired state of your infrastructure, and Terraform will handle the creation, modification, and deletion of resources to achieve that state.
- **Provider Agnostic**: Terraform supports multiple cloud providers, such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and more, making it flexible and versatile.
- **State Management**: Terraform maintains a state file to track the resources it manages, enabling it to detect changes and apply updates incrementally.
- **Plan and Apply**: Terraform allows you to preview changes (with `terraform plan`) before applying them (with `terraform apply`), reducing the risk of unexpected changes.

## Setting Up Terraform

### Prerequisites
- **CLI**: Install the Terraform CLI on your local machine.
- **Cloud Account**: Set up an account with your preferred cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
- **Editor**: Use an editor like Visual Studio Code with Terraform extensions for syntax highlighting and autocompletion.

### Installation
1. **Download Terraform**: Visit the [Terraform website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) and download the appropriate binary for your operating system.
2. **Install Terraform**: Follow the instructions to install Terraform on your machine. Verify the installation by running:
    ```bash
    terraform --version
    ```

## Terraform Basics

### Terraform Workflow
1. **Write Configuration**: Define your infrastructure resources in `.tf` files using HCL.
2. **Initialize**: Prepare your working directory for use with Terraform by running `terraform init`.
3. **Plan**: Generate an execution plan by running `terraform plan` to preview the changes that will be made.
4. **Apply**: Apply the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration by running `terraform apply`.
5. **Destroy**: If needed, delete all resources managed by the Terraform configuration by running `terraform destroy`.

### Example: Simple EC2 Instance

```hcl
# main.tf
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "TerraformExample"
  }
}
